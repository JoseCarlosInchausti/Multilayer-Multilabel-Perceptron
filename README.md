# Multilayer-Multilabel-Perceptron

## General Description:
This project implements a multilayer and multilabel perceptron capable of determining nonlinear boundaries in 2D datasets using basic matrix operations with NumPy.

## Contents:
The Jupyter Notebook `L-layer-multilabel-demo.ipynb` contains several linear and non-linear training sets, along with the `NeuralNetwork` class, which can be used to instantiate the multilayer-multilabel perceptron.

## Usage:
Before instantiating the `NeuralNetwork` class, ensure all previous cells in the notebook have been executed to import all necessary dependencies. It's important to note that convergence may not be consistently achieved in all cases. However, repeated training sessions will enable the model to eventually converge.
